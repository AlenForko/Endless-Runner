# Endless Runner Game

Welcome to my Endless Runner game, made with Unreal Engine 5.1.1 using C++ only! This is a work-in-progress game with most of the mechanics implemented and semi-polished. The game is an endless runner with obstacles and coins to collect for points. The player has 3 lives and the game gets progressively harder with speed. 

The game has been built from the ground up using C++ only, with no use of Blueprints. A variety of data structures and algorithms have been utilized to create a game with smooth and seamless gameplay mechanics. The game uses an algorithm to randomize the placement and types of obstacles to keep the gameplay experience interesting and dynamic.

## Controls

The game can be played using the following controls:

- **Space**: Jump
- **Left Arrow**: Move left
- **Right Arrow**: Move right
