# Endless Runner Game

Welcome to my Endless Runner game, made with Unreal Engine 5.1.1 using C++ only! 

Part 1 of the project has been focused on adding the main gameplay mechanics into the game, resulting in a semi-polished, work-in-progress game. 

| **Mechanics** | **Description** |
| :---: | :--- |
| Endless Runner | The game is an endless runner with no end goal other than to achieve a high score. |
| Obstacles | The game features obstacles that the player must avoid by jumping or sliding. |
| Coins | The game features coins that the player can collect for points. |
| Lives | The player has 3 lives, and losing all of them results in a game over. |
| Difficulty | The game gets progressively harder with speed. |
| Algorithm | The game uses an algorithm to randomize the placement and types of obstacles to keep the gameplay experience interesting and dynamic. |

The game has been built from the ground up using C++ only, with no use of Blueprints. A variety of data structures and algorithms have been utilized to create a game with smooth and seamless gameplay mechanics.

## Controls

The game can be played using the following controls:

- **Space**: Jump
- **A Key**: Move left
- **D Key**: Move right

##Release

You can check out the project in the Release section of this GitHub repository. Please note that the game is a work-in-progress and may not be fully polished or complete.
