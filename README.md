# Endless Runner Game

Welcome to my Endless Runner game, made with Unreal Engine 5.1.1 using C++ only! 

Part 1 of the project has been focused on adding the main gameplay mechanics into the game, resulting in a semi-polished, work-in-progress game. 

| **Mechanics** | **Description** |
| :---: | :--- |
| Endless Runner | The game is an endless runner with no end goal other than to achieve a high score. |
| Obstacles | The game features obstacles that the player must avoid by jumping or sliding. |
| Coins | The game features coins that the player can collect for points. |
| Lives | The player has 3 lives, and losing all of them results in a game over. |
| Difficulty | The game gets progressively harder with speed. |
| Algorithm | The game uses an algorithm to randomize the placement and types of obstacles to keep the gameplay experience interesting and dynamic. |

The game has been built from the ground up using C++ only, with no use of Blueprints. A variety of data structures and algorithms have been utilized to create a game with smooth and seamless gameplay mechanics.

## Controls

The game can be played using the following controls:

- **Space**: Jump
- **A Key**: Move left
- **D Key**: Move right

## Challenges Overcome

During the development of this project, several challenges were encountered and overcome. These include:

- **Dynamic Object Creation and Movement**: I had trouble creating and moving objects at the same time. But after some serious tinkering with the code and a lot of trial and error, I was able to get it working.

- **Player Movement and Game Difficulty**: Making the player run in place while the objects move towards the player created issues with creating new platforms and balancing the game difficulty. This issue still persists, but it is being dealt with.

- **Collision Detection**: Collision detection was a challenging task that required understanding of Unreal Engines physics and already implemented functions. With diligent testing and debugging, the code was optimized and the issue was overcome.

- **User Interface**: Implementing UI elements and updating the UI through C++ was a complex task. Through experimentation and thorough documentation, the task was completed successfully.

## Release

You can check out the project in the Release section of this GitHub repository. Please note that the game is a work-in-progress and may not be fully polished or complete.
